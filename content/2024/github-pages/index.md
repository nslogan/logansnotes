Well, hello again, it's been over three years since my last post. This site has been one of those things in the back of my mind, usually accompanied by "oh I'll get back to that eventually." I didn't expect "eventually" to be "three years", but here we are!

I'm not going to take the time to write up the content for this post right now, but will say that it will cover "migrating to GitHub Pages" (from traditional web hosting). I have discovered in the last three years that I _really_ don't like IT as a hobby, and that includes managing a website. However, I still value the idea of writing about interesting topics (technical or otherwise), and still aspire to make this site a place notes I take in my day-to-day can live. In pursuit of that, I decided to simplify the configuration by moving to GitHub pages.

ðŸš§ Content to come (sooner than three years) ðŸš§
