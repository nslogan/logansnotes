In late high school / early college I did web development as a side gig. By the end of my time in the web trenches I was pretty tired of it. Luckily since then it's become a lot easier to write and deploy a very nice looking website (plus I no longer have to worry about [IE6 compatibility](https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/internet-explorer-6-market-share-finally-falls-under-5/)).

I've always had a love affair with Markdown, so it seemed natural that I would want to use it to write my content. When I'm not using chisel and stone, I use Markdown for all of my notes.
