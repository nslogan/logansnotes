# Logan's Notes

![Deploy](https://github.com/nslogan/logansnotes/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg?branch=master)

Source for my personal website.

Bear with me as I migrate from my old WordPress site to this new one.

Powered by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), written in Markdown. Custom theme using [GitHub Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css/), under very active development. I plan to move the theme out of this repo into a separate one once it's stabilized. The Python aspect is managed by [pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html).
