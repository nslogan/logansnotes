# Workflow that builds and deploys the site to the webserver for logansnotes.com
name: Deploy

# 'master' should always represent a stable version of the site; all development
# pushed to the remote (github) should be done on features branches (e.g.
# feat/<name>) and testing should be done locally (i.e. via `make serve`).

  push:
